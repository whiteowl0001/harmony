                        transform it to a gorgeous stained finish, as well as create
                        a smooth surface for paint. Painting will be done as follows:
                        Finishing sanders are used to sand walls, ceilings and woodwork;
                        cracks will be repaired with fiberglass mesh tape where needed; 
                        skim coat with plaster mix will be applied to all repaired areas.
